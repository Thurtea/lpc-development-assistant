Reference Sources Guide

This file summarizes the reference archives present in `mud-references/` and how they are useful when implementing drivers or mudlibs.

Included archives (examples present in your `mud-references` folder):
- dgd-master.zip: DGD driver sources and utilities. Useful for modern driver design and distributed features.
- ds3.8.2.zip, dsI.zip, dsIIr10.zip: Variants of the Diku/Nirvana/DS family; contain legacy mudlib code and examples of LPC usage.
- final_realms_fluffos_v1.zip, lima_fluffos_v1.zip, merentha_fluffos_v2.zip, nightmare4_fluffos_v1.zip: FluffOS-compiled mudlibs and driver patches with real-world efuns, object layouts, and utilities.
- mudos_v22.2b14-ds2.tgz: MudOS family sources; good examples of VM and compiler internals.
- nightmare-3.3.1.tar.gz, nightmare3_mudos_v1.tar.gz: Historical Nightmare and MudOS variants; contain extensive mudlib code and driver hacks.

How to use:
- Run "Extract Archives" in the app to unpack these into `mud-references/extracted/<archive>/` for searching.
- Look for `*.c`, `*.h`, `*.lpc`, and `*.y` files when researching internals or examples.
- Use the `search_examples` command to locate code that contains specific keywords (e.g., "lexer", "token", "parse").

Notes:
- Many archives contain a mixture of driver code and mudlib code; pay attention to top-level directories named `src`, `driver`, `mudlib`, or `lib`.
- When copying code from references, adapt build and memory management patterns to your current driver design and C conventions.
Reference Sources Guide

This guide explains the available reference archives in mud-references/ and how to use them as context when developing drivers and mudlibs.

Included archives (already downloaded):
- dgd-master.zip
- ds3.8.2.zip
- dsI.zip
- dsIIr10.zip
- final_realms_fluffos_v1.zip
- lima_fluffos_v1.zip
- merentha_fluffos_v2.zip
- mudos_v22.2b14-ds2.tgz
- nightmare-3.3.1.tar.gz
- nightmare3_mudos_v1.tar.gz
- nightmare4_fluffos_v1.zip

How to use:
- Run "Extract Archives" from the UI to unpack these into mud-references/extracted/.
- Use the search_examples feature to find code snippets by keyword across the extracted sources.
- Prefer reading the driver and efun implementations from established projects (e.g., mudos, dgd) to learn idiomatic patterns.

Mapping suggestions:
- dgd-master, mudos: driver internals, VM and object management
- ds* and nightmare*: mudlib structure, commands, and driver integration examples
- fluffos variants: efun implementations and security considerations

When asking for code, reference this guide to instruct the model which archives to consider; the app will include the templates and can include snippets from extracted code returned by search_examples.
