This is a working, updated version of Dead Souls 1.1.

Like the 1998 release, this version of the lib is Public Domain, meaning that the
changes I have made to the lib/ directory of this distribution are not under anyone's
copyright, and you are free to do with it as you will.

Note that this does not in any way extend to the FluffOS source. The contents of
fluffos*/ are NOT public domain. That is driver source, and it is copyrighted. The maintainer
of that software is Wodan at Discworld, and he is the person you'll want to talk to
if you plan to do anything with the source other than use it for a game.

This release is very close to being 100% Descartes. Therefore please note that I
am not responsible for the brilliance you find herein, nor am I to be blamed for
any of the shortcomings.

This is *VERY OLD CODE*. I provide it as a courtesy to the curious. If you want
to start a new Dead Souls mud, I strongly encourage you to use the current
mainstream distribution (as of today, it is 2.6), available at http://dead-souls.net
