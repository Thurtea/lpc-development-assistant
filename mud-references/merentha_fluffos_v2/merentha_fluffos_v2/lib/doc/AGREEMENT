The following agreement applies to the Merentha Mudlib version 1.2.0 only.  
Other versions of the lib will not be bound by this agreement, but by
their own agreement.

All code in the Merentha Lib is intellectual property of Peter Sadlon.  
Use of the code is acceptance of the following licensing agreement.

Terms of the Agreement:

1) The Merentha Lib can not be used for profit.  You can however request
   from players donations to keep the costs of your game in check. 
   You can not require payment of any type if any of the code included

   Change of the mudlib name is governed as follows:
        You may never change the name of the Mudlib by removing the name
        Merentha from the name.  You may alter the name to reflect your
        changes, for example 'Merentha/Foo Lib' or 'Foo/Merentha Mudlib
        1.0/1.2.0' or other such change, but the word 'Merentha' must be
