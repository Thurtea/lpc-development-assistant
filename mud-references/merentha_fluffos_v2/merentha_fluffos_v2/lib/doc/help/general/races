There are 6 races in the realm which you can play.  Each race has their own advantages and disadvantages.  You should decide on what type of character you wish to play before deciding on your race and class.  

Any combination of race and class will be allowed, but there are better choices then others.  For example a giant mage is not a good idea since giants have low intelligence and a high intelligence is recommended for magi.

The 6 races are: human, giant, elf, gnome, dwarf and fariy.
