There are 4 main classes in this world.  Some are better at magic or at combat or at other apects of the game.

You do not need to join a class in Merentha II.  Instead you will go about the world, explore and learn and train your skills.  When your skills are high enough you may then choose to join a class, usually by conversing with the appropriate authorities.  Joining a class does have benefits as it will give you bonuses in certain skills and abilities.

There is no limit to the number of classes you may join, however, the more classes you join the more difficult you may find it to train your skills and advance.
