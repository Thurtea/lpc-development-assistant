The deception skills are not the key skills of any class.  Instead they are skills which everyone is equally trained in, until they take special training.  

Deception skills are:
   Bargaining - used in shops which allow bargaining to get you 
                a better price for items
   Stealth - the ability to move around unnoticed
   Stealing - the ability to pick pocket or steal items
