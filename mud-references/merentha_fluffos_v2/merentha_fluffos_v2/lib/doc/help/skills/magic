   Faith - the power to use your faith to change your environment
   Conjuring - the power to create items out of nothing
   Illusion - the power to make people believe things
   Defense Magic - the power to cast protective spells
   Attack Magic - the power to cast offensive spells
   Healing - the power to cast spells which heal
