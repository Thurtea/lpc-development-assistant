Description : Gnomes like dwarves have far above average eyesight 
              because the common gnome lives a solitary life usually 
              in a hole in a hill.  Gnomes are fairly hairy as well 
              and ususally have a brownush red coloured skin.
Occupations : Gnomes make good magicians.  Although they have the 
              stats to be pretty good fighters the typical gnome likes
              to think rather then fight.
