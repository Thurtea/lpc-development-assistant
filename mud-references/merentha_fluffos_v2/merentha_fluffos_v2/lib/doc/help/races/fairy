Description : Fairies are some of the most magical beings in the world.
              They are small and barely more then 2 feet tall but are 
              extreamly skinny and agile making them hard to hit in 
              combat. Fairy wings are often the size of the fairy 
              themselves.
Occupations : Fairies make very bad fighters because of the small size
              and weak limbs.  However they make great magic users.
