Description : Giants are perhaps the largest and strongest sentiant 
              beings of this world.  Some get as tall or taller then 
              12 feet high. A giant has grey skin and usually only 
              has a few strands of hair on their heads.
Occupations : Giants make great fighters since they lack the wisdom
              and intelligence for anything magical.
