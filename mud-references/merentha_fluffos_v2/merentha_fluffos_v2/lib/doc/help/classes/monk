Monks are perhaps the most understood and mysterious class in Merentha.  Little is known of them other then they do exist.  A monk will normally live a quite life, not interested in the ways of combat or magic.

Usually monks will train in the healing magics and excell in nature skills.  They prefer not to fight, but when they do, are unbeatable when it comes to hand to hand combat.
