The Healers of Merentha specialize in healing the ill.  Like with mages, the healer's key stats are wisdom and intelligence, though the requirements to join the healer class are not as strict.

Healers have a unique position, as they may either be magical or non magical.  Magical healing is a rather difficult skill to master as it requires intense concentration and practice.
