Fighters are those who excell in the areas of combat.  A fighter's key stats are strength and dexterity, and to a smaller amount constitution.  A fighter may choose to become expert in any number of the weapons available to him in the game.

The fighter class is perhaps one of the easiest classes to join, as they are willing to accept and train just about anyone strong enough to lift a weapon, but only those who train the hardest and devote the most time to their art will advance in the ranks.
