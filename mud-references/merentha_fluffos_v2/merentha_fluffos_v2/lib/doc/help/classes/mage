Mages are the most magical beings in Merentha.  There are many types of magic and a mage may choose to specialize in just one or in may different areas.  The main areas of magic are conjuring, illusion and combat magics.

In order to join the Mage class you must have reasonably good wisdom and intelligence stats.  You must also be already trained in the ways of magic before a magi will allow you to join.
