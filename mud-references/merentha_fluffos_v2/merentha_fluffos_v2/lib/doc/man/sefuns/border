string border(string1, string2, integer);

Will take input string1 and return string1 surrounded in a border.  String2 is an optional title which will be displayed in the center of the top row of the border.  The integer input defines the width of the screen.

If a single input line from string1 is longer then integer, the string is first wrapped.  

The use of colour is tricky when it comes to the border sefun because of the border colours.  Basiclly what the sefun will do is attempt to determine which colour to write the text.  To do this it looks at string1 and the first characters of it.  If the first part of the string is a colour code then all successive new lines in the border will be that colour.

If the string __BORDER_LINE__ is encountered in string1 it will be placed by a horizontal border line.  Take a look at the default <score> command for an example.
