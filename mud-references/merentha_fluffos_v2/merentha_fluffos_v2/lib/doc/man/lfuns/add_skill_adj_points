void add_skill_adj_points(string skill,int x);

Adds points to a given skill adjustment.  Similiar to adding points to skills, adding points to the adjustment of a skill will train the adjustment value.  When the adjustment value gets high enough the skill adjustment value is lowered, and thus the skill become easier to train.

This function is called by use_skills() and really should not be used in calls from weapons or commands.  Instead call the use_skills() function which will then call this one.
