Local Functions (/std/inheritables/room.c)

int cmd_go(string str);

This function is called internally and should not need to be called otherwise.  The init() function of the room.c inheritable uses an add_action() to send all verbs to this function.  This function then checks the exits of the room and if it finds a match moves the use through that exit.
