Welcome to the Merentha Mudlib.  All news files and welcome screens are stored in /doc/news/ and should be edited as needed.

Any questions you have about the lib can be sent to petrarch@merentha.com with "Merentha mudlib" somewhere in the subject heading, but I make no promises I will answer them.  You are bascially on your own if you choose to use this lib.
