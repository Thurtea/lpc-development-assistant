                 Merentha InterMUD System (MIS) v1.2.0-A

By default the MIS is turned off.  You can turn it on by copying 
/save/daemons/network.old to /save/daemons/network.o and rebooting your 
MUD.

MIS is designed to connect all Merentha MudLib MUDs together.  It uses UDP
datagram sockets, extreamly similar to I2 (InterMUD2).  In fact with minor
modifications the new network daemon can be converted to use with I2
instead of MIS.

There are several reasons why I chose to create MIS instead of just
connecting the Merentha Lib to I2 (or I3).
   o  I have no experience with I3
   o  There is lots of spam on I2 already
   o  This is a learning project for myself above all else
   o  MIS is designed to promote and further develop the Mer Lib

All things considered I learn't more by attempting to create my own
InterMUD System then just hooking up to an existing one.

By default the UDP port is your MUDport +6 (I2 uses +8).  Since encoding
of information on I2 is different then on MIS I have used a seperate port,
this also enables people to incorperate both InterMUDs if they wish.  I do
not know what I3 uses.  It should be noted that in reality both I2 and MIS
could interact on port +8 together and have your daemons decode which is
which, but I didn't want that.

Compatibility

MIS should work with all versions of the Mer Lib.  It should also work
with just about any other LPC lib out there, however, you will need to
write your own commands to access the network daemon and MIS.
