The Merentha MUDlib was developed for many reasons.  In the end it became
an academic exercise for myself.

As time went on the reasons for creating the lib and what became the
Merentha II MUD changed, as did the theme.  The Merentha MUDlib, and
Merentha II has many unique features which, at the time of this writing,
are not available to my knowledge in other MUDlibs.  

Starting with v0.9.3 special combat and magic rounds were added.  By using
these combat rounds instead of creating all the special combat skills in
commands you allow the possibility of targets to see an attack coming and
the chance for them to dodge it.

Starting with v1.2.0 the class system was changed.  It is now possible to
configure your MUD in such a way as to allow classes, no classes, or
multi-classing.  In fact by default the MUDlib is set up to supply all
these options.
