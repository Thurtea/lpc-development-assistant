This file is for those new to MUDs and to adminning MUDs.  Hopefully it
will give you some insight on how to avoid a few problems later on.

It will be up to you how you descide where files should go.  All files are
in a sence objects and can be classified together, but for simplicity sake
I will classify files as either:
  text file
  room file
  object file (includes all objects and monsters and so on)
  daemon file
  data file

TEXT FILES
A text file is a file like one you are reading now. They are also the help
files in the system.  These files are ment to be read as is and not
interpreted by the driver.

ROOM FILES
These files are rooms.  They are the exact same as an object file, but are
not cloned.

OBJECT FILES
These files are files for objects in the game.  They can be a park bench,
a monster, some armour, anything like that.  These files are loaded once
and then copies are cloned when needed.

DAEMON FILE
A daemon is a file which control a lot of information and is referenced
when needed.  For example the soul daemon controls all the emotes and
feelings in the game.  This file isn't an object, or a room, but it holds
information.

DATA FILE
These are player files or other saved files of information.  This
information is often read by and writen by a daemon file.


Now, where do you put all these files?
In general a good system is as follows:
  text file = /doc/
  room file = /domains/
  object file = /domains/obj/
  daemon file = /daemon/
  data file = /save/

What I would like to address in particular now are the room and object
files.  These files will make up about 95% of what players see and
experience in your game, and for the most part should be in /domains/

The other place they could exist is in /realms/  The difference between
realms and domains is the difference between things which are in the works
and things which are complete.

The standard practice is to build your new area in /realms/yourname/ and
then move it to /domains/areaname/ when you are ready to put it in the
game.  This is why you should always use header files which define
pathways of the files you use.

Now most important is the structure of /domains/
Usually the structure would look something like this:
 /domains/
 /domains/Forest/
 /domains/Forest/obj/
 /domains/Forest/obj/weapons/
 /domains/Forest/obj/armour/
 /domains/Forest/obj/monsters/
 /domains/Forest/obj/other/
 /domains/City/
 /domains/City/obj/
 /domains/City/obj/weapons/
 /domains/City/obj/armour/
 /domains/City/obj/monsters/
 /domains/City/obj/other/

and so on, and that makes sence and it works fine.  But problems can
arrise with balance very easilly.  For example lets say we had a 'thief.c'
monster both in the city and the forest.  There is little or no
consistancy between the two and their levels could be far apart.  The same
is tru if we had a 'steel sword' in both areas.

The Merentha Lib and the few areas which come with it uses a slightly
different directory structure as follows:

 /domains/
 /domains/Forest/
 /domains/City/
 /domains/obj/
 /domains/obj/weapons/
 /domains/obj/armour/
 /domains/obj/monsters/
 /domains/obj/other/

This way all the weapons for the entire game are stored in the same
directory.

You are of course free to change this as you wish.
