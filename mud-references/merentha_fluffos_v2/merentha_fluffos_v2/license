Section 1: The driver

The driver used with the Meretha Lib is MudOS_v22.2b12.  If you wish to 
recompile the driver you should download and use this driver.
==========================================================================
Section 2: The lib

The lib is defined as everyting in the dev/lib directory.  All code in the 
lib has been writen by Peter Sadlon and all is his own original work.  You 
are free to use the lib if you wish, as long as you follow the following 
rules:
  1) You are not allowed to use the lib for profit
  2) You are not allowed to redistribute the lib as anyone's work but mine
  3) You may not change the name of the lib 

For more information and a more complete license agreement read the 
dev/lib/doc/AGREEMENT file.  The dev/lib/doc directory also contains 
documentation on the lib itself which you may find useful.

The Merentha Lib is distributed in several stages of development.  This 
information is stored in the VERSIONS file of the directory mentioned 
above.  The different versions may be of more or less use to certain 
people depending on how much of their own lib they wish to create 
themselves.

Section 3: Startup Notes - Trouble Shooting

In general a command like ./start lib will start your MUD.  This section
lists some problems I've discovered and their solutions:

MUD starts/crashes and reboots - This could be because of problems with
your machine's internet connection, or if it isn't conneted at all.  The
problem is that Merentha InterMUD System (MIS) attempts to start up and
with no Internet connection there are problems.  To fix this remove the
/save/daemons/network.o file and restart your MUD.  When this file is
deleted there are no other MUDs to contact and it should start fine.
