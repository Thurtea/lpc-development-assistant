1) cd fluffos-2.9-ds2.03
2) ./configure merentha
3) make
4) make install
5) cd ../bin
6) vi config

change the following entries:

name
mudlib directory
binary directory
port number

7) ./driver ./config &
8) telnet localhost 6622

9) You will now need to log the default admin in, make your new
   character an admin, then with your new admin delete the default admin
   (for security reasons).
   This is how:
   a) Log in with the character "admin" password "admin"
   b) Once you are logged in, type "promote <char> <position>"
      (your new character must still be logged in at this time)
      If <position> is set to be player, they are a player.  If it
      is set to anything else they are an administrator, so type
      something like "promote petrarch admin"
   c) Log out the "admin" character and log your new character back in.
      Type "rid admin".  This will delete that default character.  You
      must remove this admin character, otherwise it is a security risk.
