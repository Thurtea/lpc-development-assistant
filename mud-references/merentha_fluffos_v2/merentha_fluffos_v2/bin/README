==========================================================================
Section 1 - The driver

The Merentha Lib was developed with MudOS_v22.2b12.  If you wish to make 
changes to the driver you should use this version, it is the only 
known version to be 100% compatable.  The MUDlib has not been tested with 
any other drivers.  Though there is nothing special configured into the
driver and it should be possible to use any MudOS version above v20.

The driver supplied has pretty much all sefuns needed for day to day
operations and all memory reporting options enabled.  These options
require a little more memory and CPU power to run.

You can download the driver source from http://www.mudos.org if you wish,
the local_options file is included here as well in the /bin/ directory.
The mudlib does not use either euids or privs and there may be still other
options unique to the lib.  The local_options file should be copied to the
driver's source directory and edited from there if you wish to use it when
recompiling a new driver.
==========================================================================
Section 2 - The config file
 
Edit the config file as needed.  Be sure to edit the MUD NAME and 
directory sections.  You may also wish to edit the port number and other 
options.

These options were used on Merentha and ran fine with 100+ players
==========================================================================
Section 3 - The start script

The start script is rather simple.  It will start your mud and reboot it 
incase of a crash or reboot.

You must first edit the startscript and make sure the proper directory is 
used.  Then to run the script you must type

./start lib &

You will then see a message appear saying the MUD is up and running.  
Ignore the messages about the address server.  This has been disabled in 
the fact that the address server binary is not supplied.  It is found by 
myself that the address server is more of a pain then anything else.  If 
you wish to have an address server you will have to recompile the driver.

In the case that the screen continually scrolls with the same messages 
over and over again, there has been a problem starting your MUD.  You will 
have to kill the start process.  Usually this is done by the command:

kill %1

The problem is usually in the start file or the config.lib file.  Be sure
the pathways of all directories are correct.  The problem could also be
the Merentha InterMUD system.  I suggest removeing the
/save/daemons/network.o file and restarting your MUD.  This may fix the
problem.
