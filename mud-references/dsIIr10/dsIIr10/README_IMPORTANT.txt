This means that it is lacking some documentation.

Some of the code in Dead Souls 2 that was not written by me is not in Dead Souls II.

Dead Souls II is for hardcore do-it-yourselfers that need to be 100% free
of any licensing on the mudlib.

Perhaps they want to sell their work. Perhaps they want to make their
own mudlib distribution. Such people have special needs.

This is most likely not you.

Normal people who just want to run a mud are much better off using
the regular distribution, which you can download from here:
