Whatever the law says, so it applies here.

Dead Souls II is Public Domain.

The library distribution (the stuff in lib/) is public domain software. 
This means that the changes I have made to 
the lib/ directory are not under anyone's copyright, and you are 
free to do with it as you will. 

Note that this does not extend to any of the 2.x releases of Dead Souls.

Also note that this does not in any way extend to the MudOS/FluffOS source,
or the compiled Windows executable.
The contents of fluffos*/ are NOT public domain. That is driver source,
and it is copyrighted. The maintainer of that software is Wodan at 
Discworld, and he is the person you'll want to talk to if you plan
to do anything with the source other than use it for a game.

To understand the differences between Dead Souls 2.x and Dead Souls II,
please visit http://dead-souls.net/ds-II-faq.html

Most newcomers to Dead Souls interested in running a mud
are best served by using the regular version, not this version.
The regular version can be downloaded from http://lpmuds.net/downloads.html
